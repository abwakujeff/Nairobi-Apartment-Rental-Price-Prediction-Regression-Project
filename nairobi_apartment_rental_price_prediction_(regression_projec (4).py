#Nairobi Apartment Rental Price Prediction (Regression Projec

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end regression project to predict property prices in Nairobi. We load the provided dataset, clean and preprocess it, perform exploratory analysis, engineer features, and train multiple models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) to compare their performance.   
 We evaluate each model using regression metrics (R², RMSE, MAE) and save the best model. Throughout, we add clear comments and structure it as a portfolio-ready Colab notebook.

#1. Data Loading and Inspection
"""

# Import core libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('Nairobi propertyprices - Sheet1.csv')

# Inspect the first rows and basic info
df.head()

# Check dataset shape and column types
print(f"Dataset shape: {df.shape}")
df.info()

"""#2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

We perform several cleaning steps:
* Clean Price: Remove currency (“KSh”), commas, and spaces, then convert to numeric. This matches known issues in this dataset

.
* Convert area units: Standardize House size and Land size to numeric values in square meters. For example, we extract digits from “230 m²” or “0.5 acres” and convert acres to m² (1 acre = 4046.86 m²)

.
* Handle missing values: Many Vacant Land entries have no bedrooms or bathrooms. We fill missing numeric values with 0 (since a land plot has no bedroom/bathroom) and 0 for missing house/land sizes accordingly.

* Encode categorical features: Convert propertyType and Location into numeric dummy/indicator variables. Categorical encoding is an essential feature-engineering step so that ML models can use these attributes
